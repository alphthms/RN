      <h2>1. Intro</h2>
      <p>
        We are from UTC Portsmouth KS4 and our challenge is to design, build and
        create a watercraft that can pick up objects and debris from the sea
        bed. As a team we have selected different roles for each member in our
        team, these are

       <h4><br>Alphonse Thomas - Team Leader<br> <br>Chloe Woolgar - Boat Designer<br><br>Joshua Tony - Budgeter<br><br>Joe Ware - Tester<br><br>Richard Oluwabiyi - Researcher<br></h4>

      <h2>2. Intial Ideas</h2>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
     <p>Our final design is to use a crane that will be able to reach the bottom of the water. It will be attached to the top of the boat, allowing us to go to the bottom of the tank and pick up the objects to put onto the boat. The crane will be positioned so that the weight is dispersed throughout the boat, as well as allowing a lot of storage for the objects to be placed. Also, because of the many needed materials, the crane will rotate so that the mechanism is less likely to fail. It will have outriggers made of plastic attached to both sides of the boat.
